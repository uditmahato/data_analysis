class is blueprint of the object

how the thing will look 

Object is a instanciation of the class
several objects can be made in a class

init is not required in python
init is a special method that is called when an object is created
init is used to initialize the object
init is used to set the default values of the object
init is used to set the values of the object
init also determine the size of the object


cls determine current class
reference variable points object
also used to change the property of object


class person():
   pass

p=person()

p is refresh variable here we are creating object of the class person


dunder....constructor is anything that builds( initializer because initialize property of an object) the object.
It also determine the size of the object.



#in python everything is an object because all the data has method like sort


##variables in OOP 
1.Instance variable --variable whose value changes from object to object also called object variable-
in class self
and outiside class object name


2.Static Variable or Class variable --variable whose value changes from class to class


Instance Method must have  self as first parameter
IT is used access the data of Instance Variable
It is called by object name

Class method must have class as first parameter
IT is used to access the data of Class Variable
It is called by class name if inside class
and used cls if in method
class is reserved word


Static method doesn't depend on neither class nor object
It is called by the name of class


if you can access the data from outiside of the class  then it is insecure because it ca be changed by anyone 
with unwanted value o we need to hide it
